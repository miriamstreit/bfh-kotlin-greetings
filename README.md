# Greetings
 
Write a method `getGreeting` that receives a String as an input and returns a String. It accepts one of the following cities as input:
Berlin, Bern, London, Boston, Paris, Milano, Madrid

If any other city is provided as input, the method returns a String "City not found!".

Depending on the language spoken in the specific city, it returns Hello!, Bonjour!, Ciao!, Hola! or Guten Tag!

Make sure the program does accept case-insensitive input (e.g. Berlin, BERlin, berlin etc.).
 
_@Kotlin: Write a function `getGreeting` instead a static method._
